tvgids
======

This an online TV guide for Dutch TV channels, realized using the TVGids.nl
API. This web page is designed to be an alternative for
http://tvgids.nl/lijsten/horizontaal, offering a quick-to-use interface that
saves preferences (e.g. favorite channels) in HTML5 local storage, rather than
requiring a registered account.

A working version is available at http://tvgids.tkroes.nl.

Features
--------
- Complete list of programs for 123 channels.
- See programs from 2 days before and 2 days ahead.
- Select favourite channels (saved using HTML5 local storage).
- Click on a program to see detailed information (screen-scraped from
  TVGids.nl).
- Select favourite programs, which remain highlighted in the future (saved
  using HTML5 local storage).
- An IMDB link is added to the details pane for movies.

Issues & TODO
-------------
- Add timestamp to favourite programs, and remove entries older than 7 days to
  prevent clogging.
