tvgids
======

This an online TV guide for Dutch TV channels, realized using the TVGids.nl
API. This web page is designed to be an alternative for
http://tvgids.nl/lijsten/horizontaal, offering a quick-to-use interface that
saves preferences (e.g. favorite channels) in HTML5 local storage, rather than
requiring a registered account.

A working version is available at http://tkroes.nl/tvgids.

Issues & TODO
-------------
- Add timestamp to favourite programs, and remove entries older than 7 days to
  prevent clogging
