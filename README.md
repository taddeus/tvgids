tvgids
======

This an online TV guide for Dutch TV channels, realized using the
tvgids.nl API. This web page is designed to be an alternative for
tvgids.nl/lijsten/horizontaal/, offering a quick-to-use interface
that saves preferences (e.g. favorite channels) in HTML5 local
storage rather than requiring a registered account.

A working version is available at http://tkroes.nl/tvgids/.

Issues & TODO
-------------
- Some channels show no programs.
- Load and render the first set of programs in PHP, maybe that's faster.
